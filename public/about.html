<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a detail-oriented software product development professional with 15+ years
  of experience in fast-paced startup environments. I'm passionate about
  improving people's lives with thoughtful, high-quality software solutions to
  address the needs of the user.

<p>
  As a product manager, I successfully led the development and launch of
  enterprise mobile and web IoT platform transportation products. I created and
  executed comprehensive product strategies, collaborated with cross-functional
  teams throughout the product lifecycle, and ensured the delivery of new
  features and products to market. I also conducted extensive data analysis to
  evaluate product performance and inform decision-making. These experiences
  have equipped me with a deep understanding of the product management lifecycle
  and the ability to drive product success.

<p>
  I'm learning full stack web development to increase my technical skills and
  eventually move to a software engineering role. I love product, but I love
  understanding the code even more.
